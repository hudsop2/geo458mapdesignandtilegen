# Map Design and Tile Generation
### By: Hudson Potts

## Geographic Area and Zoom Levels

The 4 maps presented are meant to focus on Washington state, but the map is detailed throughout the greater Pacific Northwest Region of the United States and parts of southern British Columbia. Zooming outside of this region will lead to a lack of detail in the map. Zooming inside of a county range to a city level the map becomes blurry and less detailed. Inbetween these zoom ranges the tile set does a quality job of portraying the map in detail.

#### Basemap
This tileset will show you a monochrome map with dark font and some simplified landscape.
